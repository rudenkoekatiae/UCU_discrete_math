# UCU_discrete_math_labs
This module implements a collection of Python functions for working with relations represented as matrices.

It provides utilities to read and write relation matrices from files, compute symmetric, reflexive, and transitive closures, check transitivity, and find equivalence classes. It also includes a function to count all transitive relations on a set of given size.

All functions include doctests that can be executed to verify correctness.
